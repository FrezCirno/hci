# Project Background

- **What is Data Visualization?**

    Data visualization is primarily designed to communicate and communicate information clearly and effectively through graphical means. 

    In order to effectively convey the concept of ideas, aesthetic forms and functions need to go hand in hand to achieve insight into fairly sparse and complex data sets by visually communicating key aspects and features.

- **The basic idea of Data Visualization technology?**

    To represent each data item in the database as a single primitive element. A large number of data sets constitute a data image, and each attribute value of the data is represented in the form of multidimensional data, which can be observed from different dimensions. Data to allow for more in-depth observation and analysis of the data.
